A StarCraft 2 Region ID is a combination of a <i>Server ID</i> and a <i>Player ID</i> that identifies a player in a Blizzard server. 

<b>To get your StarCraft 2 Region Id:</b>
1️ Go to https://starcraft2.com/ and log in.
2️ Clic in view profile
3️ Copy the URL of your profile
4️ Send it to me using /link command:
<code>/link [your_starcraft2_URL]</code>

ℹ️ If you play in more than one server (e.g., EU, US) you will need to link each URL if you want to track the matches from every server
