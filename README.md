# SC2Helperbot
SC2 Helper Bot is a project to help handling competitive data from StarCraft 2 using Telegram Bot API.


## Setup
Setting up the Bot is relatively painless - just run `& python main.py`

The main configuration file is `settings.py`, but it is not included by default. Simply make a copy of `example_settings.py` and rename it to `settings.py`. See `example_settings.py` for more information about configurations.
