# SC2Helperbot
SC2 Helper Bot is a project to help handling competitive data from StarCraft 2 using Telegram Bot API.


## Setup
Setting up the Bot is relatively painless - just run `& python main.py`

The main configuration file is `.env`, but it is not included by default. Simply make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. See `.env.example` for more information about configurations.
